			<h2>Kent E. Holsinger</h2> 
			<h4>Chair</h4>
			<p>Dr. Holsinger is a Professor of Ecology &amp; Evolutionary Biology and Adjunct Professor of Statistics at the University of Connecticut, Storrs.  His previous awards include the Chancellor’s Information Technology Award (2000), the Service Excellence Award from the Connecticut Chapter of the AAUP (2007), and the Faculty Award for Research Excellence – Sciences from the UConn Alumni Association (2007). He was elected a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2003 and of the Connecticut Academy of Science and Engineering in 2010. In 2006, he received the Centennial Award from the Botanical Society of America and the Distinguished Alumni Award from the College of Idaho in 2008.</p>
			<p>Professor Holsinger is well known for his work in population genetics, plant evolutionary biology, and conservation biology. His most influential work involves the development and analysis of mathematical models that describe the evolution of plant mating systems and of statistical models used to analyze genetic variation within populations. His most recent work on mechanisms responsible for the extraordinary diversity of plants in southwestern South Africa has uncovered a complex interplay between adaptation to environmental gradients and the accumulation of random differences among geographically isolated population. This work involves students, post-doctoral research associates, faculty, and collaborators at the University of Connecticut, the University of California-Davis, the Australian National University, the University of Wageningen (Netherlands), the South African National Biodiversity Institute, and the South African Environmental Observation Network.</p>
			<p>Professor Holsinger is also a dedicated educator. He regularly teaches an undergraduate course in evolutionary biology and graduate courses in population genetics and conservation biology. For many years he taught in the introductory biology course for biology majors, and for nearly fifteen years, he co-taught a course in philosophy of science. He has supervised the work of nine Ph.D. students and one M.S. student, and served on the advisory committee of more than fifty students in seven departments and two colleges. In addition, he has served as an external reviewer on Ph.D. dissertations at four universities in the U.S., three in Europe, and two in Australia, and he has served as the thesis advisor for four University of Connecticut Honors scholars and one University Scholar.</p>
			<p>Professor Holsinger has a long history of service to his department, the University, and the profession, including his service for a year and a half as an acting department head. He recently served as Chair of the Senate Executive Committee, stepping down when he took up his current position as Vice Provost for Graduate Education and Dean of the Graduate School. He has served as President of the American Genetics Association, the American Institute of Biological Sciences, and the Botanical Society of America. Since 2000, he has served as Chair of the Board of Directors of BioOne. He has served on grant and fellowship review panels for many federal agencies, and on the editorial board of eleven scientific journals.</p>

			<h2>Town Peterson</h2><br />
			<p>Town Peterson is University Distinguished Professor in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, and Curator in Ornithology in the Biodiversity Institute, at the University of Kansas. He is co-appointed in the following departments and programs: Global and International Studies, African and African American Studies, Latin American Studies, Department of Geography, and Environmental Studies, and has been an adjunct faculty member in the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México for more than two decades. He also coadvises students based at the University of the Western Cape (Cape Town, South Africa), Cape Peninsula University of Technology (Cape Town, South Africa), and Isfahan University of Technology (Iran), among others.</p>
			<p>Peterson’s research extends broadly across questions of the geography of biodiversity. That is, he focuses on the question of why species and other elements of biodiversity are where they are, and why they are not where they are not. His approaches to this question range from quantitative geography and remote sensing analyses to molecular phylogenetics and phylogeography. His training is in systematic ornithology, but his work extends broadly across many taxa, including pathogens and questions of the geography of disease transmission. His research productivity can be seen at <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uRZIRj0AAAAJ&hl=en">here.</a></p>
			<p>Peterson has also worked many years in the area of improving and opening access to scientific data and scholarly publications. Specifically, he led and co-led several initiatives in promoting and enabling access to data associated with museum specimens (see, e.g., <a href="http://www.vertnet.org/">vertnet.org</a>). He co-led efforts to develop, pass, and implement a faculty open access policy at the University of Kansas, the first in the nation at a public university, and has dedicated years of effort to supporting the broader goal of opening access to KU scholarship. Most recently, he has dedicated considerable time and effort to development of the Biodiversity Informatics Training Curriculum (<a href="http://biodiversity-informatics-training.org/">biodiversity-informatics-training.org</a>), an effort to create open-access teaching materials for the field of biodiversity informatics via in-person training activities in cities across Africa, with all program activities captured digitally and served via YouTube.</p>

			<p>Dr. Savitzky’s research concerns the integrative biology of amphibians and reptiles, especially snakes. His specific interests include the evolutionary morphology of feeding and defensive structures, evolutionary development of sensory organs and glands, and most recently the evolution of chemical defenses in snakes. Dr. Savitzky’s recent work has been focused on Asian snakes that sequester toxins from toads consumed as prey and later deploy those toxins for their own defense. That work has involved extensive collaborations with biologists and chemists in the U.S. and Japan. Dr. Savitzky also has been involved in various conservation issues and directed a 19-year ecological study of a state-endangered rattlesnake in Virginia before moving to Utah in 2011.</p>
