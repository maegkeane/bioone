Her role as ambassador for the organization’s nonprofit mission has become increasingly international, as sales have expanded worldwide and the publications themselves now originate in over 15 countries. Facilitator of the BioOne team, Susan is responsible for working with management and the board to position the organization for a sustainable future and encourage each individual’s active connection with the mission. Susan frequently speaks on BioOne’s history and evolving business models.
