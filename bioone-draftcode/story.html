		<h1>Our Story</h1>
	</header>
	<p>BioOne evolved from the kernel of an idea scribbled on a napkin into an eight million dollar per year organization serving over 140 nonprofit publishers, 4,000 libraries, and millions of researchers, educators, and students around the globe.</p> 
	<h2>A Community Need</h2>
	<p>In the late 90s, the scholarly community was concerned that electronic publishing in the sciences was being ceded to commercial interests. In this climate, small to mid-size society publishers wishing to remain independent would be excluded from the online publishing arena without a sustainable, nonprofit alternative.</p>
	<div>
	BioOne is a sustainable, nonprofit alternative for independent publishers
	</div>
	<p>
	In the basement of Teller’s Restaurant in Lawrence, Kansas in 1999, far-sighted librarians and publishers Guy Dresser, Ted Freeman, Adrian Alexander, and William Crowe met to discuss an idea to address this growing concern. Their initial ideas for a collaborative endeavor with stakeholders from both sides of the scholarly publishing enterprise—librarians and publishers—grew into today's BioOne.
	</p>
	<div>
	BioOne was created to respond to the necessity of and demand for a viable alternative to the pricing practices of commercial publishing
	</div>
	<h2>Founding</h2>
	<p>Later that year, BioOne was incorporated as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation, founded by Allen Press, AIBS, the Big 12 Plus Libraries Consortium (now GWLA), The University of Kansas, and SPARC.
	</p> 
	<p>BioOne was also made possible by the library community, specifically the 123 libraries who pledged initial funds. Given the strained library budgets of the time, these institutions committed to invest in a project that, despite everyone’s best intentions, could very well have failed. This community support further demonstrated the necessity of and demand for a viable alternative to the pricing practices of commercial publishing.
	</p>
	<p>Within five years, BioOne was self-sustaining. In its seventh year, BioOne was able to repay every charter supporter in full. We have included a list of these supporters below and thank them wholeheartedly.</p>
	<div>
	When we balance the needs of the whole community, we work towards a sustainable future for scholarly publishing
	</div>
	<h2>Today</h2>
	<p>BioOne is more than a database. BioOne is a publishing organization dedicated to the firm belief that we work better when we work together and balance the needs of the whole community for a sustainable future. Our flagship product BioOne Complete continues to provide researchers with high-impact science, libraries with a reasonably priced database, and publishers with a home for their work. Innovative problem-solving created BioOne and we continue that legacyby incubating new projects like Elementa: Science of the Anthropocene, our first open-access journal.
	</p>
	<p>
	With an ever-changing landscape accelerated by new technologies, we know there’s more work to do.
